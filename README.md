**Objectives:**
The main objective of a Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program is to provide a simple yet effective method for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest substitution ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Features:**
1. **Encryption:** The program should be able to take a plaintext message and encrypt it using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
2. **Decryption:** It should also have the capability to take a Caesar Cipher encrypted message and decrypt it to reveal the original plaintext.
3. **Customization:** Users should be able to choose the shift value for encryption and decryption.
4. **Alphabet Support:** The program should support both uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
5. **Error Handling:** It should handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input or out-of-range shift values.
6. **User Interface:** Optionally, a user-friendly interface could be implemented to facilitate ease of use.

**Functionality:**
1. **Encryption:** The program takes a plaintext message and a shift value as input, then shifts each letter of the message by the specified number of positions to produce the encrypted text.
2. **Decryption:** Similarly, it takes an encrypted message and the same shift value used for encryption, then shifts each letter in the opposite direction to decrypt the message.
3. **User Interaction:** It prompts the user to input the message and the shift value, then displays the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.
4. **Error Handling:** It ensures that the shift value is within the valid range (0-25) and handles any other input errors to prevent program crashes.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, a Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program provides a basic yet fundamental tool for encoding and decoding messages. While it may not offer the same level of security as more complex encryption algorithms, it serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding the principles of cryptography. Additionally, it can be used for simple encryption tasks where high security is not a primary concern, such as creating puzzles or encoding casual messages.
